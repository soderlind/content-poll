# ContentPoll AI

**A modern, accessible polling block that lets visitors vote on questions about your content, with beautiful card-style options and optional AI suggestions.**



Engage your audience by asking them to vote on aspects of the page they're reading. AI analyzes your content and suggests relevant polling questions, or create your own. Visitors vote once anonymously, then see real-time results with visual progress bars.

**Perfect for**: Blog posts, product pages, documentation, news articles, tutorials, reviews – any content where you want to gauge reader opinions or preferences.
