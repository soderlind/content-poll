# Tutorial: content-poll

**ContentPoll AI** is a WordPress plugin that lets editors easily add interactive polls to posts and pages.  
Site visitors can vote anonymously—choosing from *custom questions and options*—and instantly view aggregated results.  
Editors can use built-in or *AI-assisted suggestion tools* (supporting providers like OpenAI, Gemini, Anthropic, & more) to generate poll questions and options based on page content.  
Everything is stored securely & privately, with **real-time analytics**, privacy-first vote tracking (no personal data), and a modern Gutenberg block UI.  
The system is built to be *secure, extensible, and testable*, following WordPress coding standards.
